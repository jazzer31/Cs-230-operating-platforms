1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client is The gaming room, in an effort to to expand their business they want to develop a web based version of their existing game Draw it or lose it.
The new web based version of the was to serve multiple platforms from the same source.
The game logic had the following required funtions:A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved, each team will have multiple players,
game and team names must be unique, only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.

2) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was really proud of my reccomendation. I spent good amount of time on them doing research and thinking through what was needed.

3) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

putting the requirements in writing provied a fairly strong outline that helps get started, which is something at time I struggle with.

4) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I felt that my Evaluation section was not clear enough, to remedy this isssue I would start earlier and spend more time prepping for it.

5) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The first thing I did was read the entire prompt for each project week without considering the project, then I idetified logical breaks to segment the prompt.
After this I read each section jotting down important points for each. Once I had bullet points for each segment I compared them to each other and considered how they may be liked.
This helps me see the ideas that may have led to the formation of the prompt. The needs of the user's are so important because they are who the program are for,
If the users will not enjoy and enteract with the program then the program has no useful pupose.

6) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approach all software projects the same way, stage one is research, stage two planning (a little whiteboard work), stage three throw the spaghetti at the wall,
stage 4 refactor. I really enjoyed the design patterns, I will most certainly be using the singleton in the future and will likely make use of the factory pattern all the time as well
